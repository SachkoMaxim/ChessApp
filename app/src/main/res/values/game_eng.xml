            "<div style='width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;'>Chess is played by two players on
                a board with 64 black and white cells, white and black pieces. A chessboard is usually called a chessboard. The
                chessboard is placed in such a way that its first horizontal is near the player playing white. At the same time, the
                rightmost corner field <b>h1</b> must be white. Each player has <span style='color: red;'>16</span> chess pieces:
                <span style='color: blue;'>eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen and a king</span>. Players make
                moves in turn. During each turn, a player can move <span style='color: red;'>only one</span> piece. An exception is
                <b>castling</b> — a joint move of rook and king. The game begins with the player playing with white pieces. When
                moving your piece to a cell occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board. Such a
                move is called taking.</div><br/>"

                <span style='color: blue; font-style: italic;'>Pawn</span> — moves forward only vertically. The first move of a
                pawn — white from the second, and black from the seventh horizontal — can be made two cells at once, jumping over
                the third or sixth horizontal. From all other horizontals, the pawn can only move one cell forward. In addition,
                the pawn can take any piece of the opponent that is in front of him at a distance of one cell diagonally. If the
                white pawn has reached the eighth horizontal, or the black one — the first, then it can turn into any piece
                (except the king) of the same color as the pawn.</div><br/>"

                Castling</b></span> — is a move in chess in which the king is moved from his initial position across
                one cell horizontally with the simultaneous movement of the rook to this cell. Castling is performed
                as follows: the king moves horizontally two cells. At the same time, the rook is set on the cell through
                which the king jumped, that is, the king is behind the rook with which he castled. Castling is considered
                the king's move and the player must move the king first, and then the rook. In chess notation, a short rook
                is written as <span style='font-style: italic;'>\"0-0\"</span>, a long one
                is <span style='font-style: italic;'>\"0-0-0\"</span></div><br/>"
